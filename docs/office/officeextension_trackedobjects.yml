    summary: >-
      Track a new object for automatic adjustment based on surrounding changes in the document. Only some object types
      require this. If you are using an object across ".sync" calls and outside the sequential execution of a ".run"
      batch, and get an "InvalidObjectPath" error when setting a property or invoking a method on the object, you needed
      to have added the object to the tracked object collection when the object was first created.

      Release the memory associated with an object that was previously added to this collection. Having many tracked
      objects slows down the host application, so please remember to free any objects you add, once you're done using
      them. You will need to call "context.sync()" before the memory release takes effect.
